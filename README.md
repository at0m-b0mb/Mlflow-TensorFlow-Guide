## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- **Notebook:** The main notebook for running the code is available [here](https://github.com/at0m-b0mb/Mlflow-Tensorflow-Demo/blob/main/MLFlow%20Tensorflow%20Model%20Kailash.ipynb).

### Building and Compiling the Model
In the notebook, the following key steps are demonstrated:

1. Import necessary libraries, including TensorFlow, MLflow, and more.
2. Load and preprocess fashion MNIST dataset.
3. Build a neural network model using TensorFlow.
4. Compile the model with loss and optimizer.
5. Train the model with training and validation data.

### Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated on the test dataset, and accuracy metrics are reported.

## Usage
You can use this project as a guide to working with TensorFlow and MLflow for building and evaluating machine learning models.
